GoMamam — Concept Web App Prototype

A frontend-only improvement concept for the GoMamam food delivery platform, built using React + Vite.
This project demonstrates improvements that may be integrated into the existing Gomamam app, including UI/UX enhancements, AI-driven food recommendations, improved browsing, and a modern settings page, designed as part of an academic product-improvement assignment.

🚀 Overview

The objective is to address current pain points, improve customer decision-making, enhance personalization, and present a more modern and intuitive interface — all without a backend.

This demo includes:

AI-powered(fake) restaurant & food recommendations

A redesigned browsing experience with filters

Restaurant detail pages + separate review pages

A Settings panel with interactive toggles

A polished, production-quality UI & UX flow

📌 Features
🔥 1. AI Recommendations (Home Page)

A carousel that shows personalized suggestions based on:
✔ Order history patterns
✔ Budget tendencies
✔ Favourite cuisines
✔ Dish similarity

Each recommendation displays:

Restaurant

Dish name

Price

Reason for recommendation

High-quality food image

🍽️ 2. Improved Browse Page

A cleaner, more informative list of restaurants:

Promos, tags, rating indicators

Filters by rating, price, cuisine

Clickable rating → goes to restaurant reviews

⭐ 3. Restaurant Reviews

Shows food vs delivery reviews separately (concept improvement).

⚙️ 4. Settings Page 

Notification settings page with functional toggles
